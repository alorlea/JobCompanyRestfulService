JobCompanyRestfulService
========================

This was part of an assignment of programming web services in KTH. Here we learned to design and implement our own restful web service. In this case, the scenario corresponds to a Job Search company were it allows users to search for companies and upload their transcripts in order to apply for jobs. We used the tutorial from IBM to learn the basics. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-aj-tomcat/index.html
